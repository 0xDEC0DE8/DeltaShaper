# DeltaShaper

DeltaShaper takes advantage of the encrypted video channel of widely used videoconferencing applications, such as Skype, as a carrier for unobservable covert TCP/IP communications. We have built a censorship-resistant system, named DeltaShaper, which offers a data-link interface and supports TCP/IP applications that tolerate low throughput / high latency links. Our results show that is possible to run standard protocols such as FTP, SMTP, or HTTP over Skype video streams. In our [paper](http://web.ist.utl.pt/diogo.barradas/papers/DeltaShaper_PETS17.pdf), we propose and evaluate different alternatives to encode information in the video stream in order to increase available throughput while preserving the packet-level characteristics of the video stream.


The prototype presented in this codebase represents a proof-of-concept of our system.
